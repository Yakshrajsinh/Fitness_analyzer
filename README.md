# 🏃 Personal Fitness Tracker – Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Personal Fitness Tracker** is a menu-driven Python application that analyzes fitness activity data using **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  
It helps users load, clean, analyze, and visualize workout records such as duration, calories burned, and activity types.

This project is designed as an **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) dashboard** and aligns with academic requirements for **NumPy, Pandas, and Data Visualization**.
